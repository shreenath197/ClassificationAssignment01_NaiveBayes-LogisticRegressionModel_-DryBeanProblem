ClassificationAssignment01_NaiveBayes&LogisticRegressionModel_ DryBeanProblem
Case Study:

Let's assume you are a data scientist, and you have been tasked with a classification problem of a Dry Bean

About the dataset:

Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type, and structure by the market situation. A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.

Tasks:

Q1) Perform data loading, preprocessing by dropping any rows with 'NaN' values in the 'Class' column. [1M]

Q2) Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y), and further divide into training and test sets. [Consider test_size=0.2]  [1M]

Q3) Perform data scaling and modelling. [1M]

Q4) Train Naive bayes and logistic regression [2 M]

Q5) Evaluate the model performance using a classification report and accuracy score and compare both the models [2M]

Q6) Plot a confusion matrix as a heatmap, offering a visual representation of the model's performance, illustrating True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives for both models. [2M]

Q7) Write some conclusion commenting which model is better and why ? [1M]
